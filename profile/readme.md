# Owl's shed

Hello and welcome to Owl's shed *(my shed)*. \
*<sub>A metaphorical shed, as I do not actually own a physical one.</sub>*

This organisation exist as a fun little project for me to basically, *uhhhh*...
make knockoffs of my own projects...?

Yeah, basically I already have an organisation
*([Owl's domain](https://github.com/Owl-Domain))*, that's intended for making
high quality QoL software, but uhh, it's kinda empty, and it'll take me a while
to make and redesign everything that I want for that organisation, and
***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*** it's ***SO STRESSFUL***. So this is
basically like a mini vacation for me to have some fun, and make some QoL
software that I've wanted to make for ages.

Yeah that's about it. Don't expect extremely high quality or polished products,
and do not expect any seriousness or so called *"professionalism"*. I'm here to
have some fun, and some fun I shall have.
